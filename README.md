# Carbon Dioxide and Temperature Over Time

## Project Link

<https://alienjao.quarto.pub/carbon-dioxide/>

## Summary

Carbon dioxide is increasing the global temperature. The data I used were pulled from various different data sets, including carbon dioxide emissions, temperature change, land temperature, and population on kaggle. I grouped them together by country and year. I also shortened them to only 1990 to 2018.

## Model Summaries

-   Bayesian regression model with carbon dioxide emissions as the dependent variable and year as the independent variable
-   Bayesian regression model with average land temperature as the dependent variable and year as the independent variable

## Takeaway

Around 53,000 (+/- 2000) metric tons of carbon dioxide is going to be in the year 2025 and the average land temperature is going to be 20.6 C (+/- 0.6).
